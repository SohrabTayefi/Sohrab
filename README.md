👨‍💻 With a diploma and bachelor's degree in computer engineering, as well as an international CIW certificate under my belt, I've been deeply immersed in the world of programming from a young age.

🚀 I embarked on my programming journey at the tender age of 14, exploring various languages and technologies along the way. Fast forward to today, and I've honed my expertise over the years, particularly in mobile development, which has been my focus for the past 3 years.
