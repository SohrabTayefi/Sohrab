👨‍💻 With a diploma and bachelor's degree in computer engineering, as well as an international CIW certificate under my belt, I've been deeply immersed in the world of programming from a young age.

🚀 I embarked on my programming journey at the tender age of 14, exploring various languages and technologies along the way. Fast forward to today, and I've honed my expertise over the years, particularly in mobile development, which has been my focus for the past 3 years.

💼 I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects, spanning different languages and platforms, each presenting its unique set of challenges and learning opportunities.

🎮 But it's not all about code for me! When I'm not crafting elegant solutions, you'll often find me diving into the adrenaline-fueled worlds of Dota 2 and CS:GO. Gaming isn't just a hobby; it's where I find inspiration and recharge my creative batteries.

☕ And when I'm seeking a different kind of adventure, I love exploring the great outdoors, indulging in some quality reading time, or catching the latest blockbuster on the silver screen. But no matter where I am or what I'm doing, you can bet there's a delicious cup of coffee by my side.
